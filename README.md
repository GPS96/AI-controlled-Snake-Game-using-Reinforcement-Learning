# AI-controlled-Snake-Game-using-Reinforcement-Learning
Hands on experience with Reinforcement Learning by controlling the conventional Snake Game with AI.

Everything has been built from scratch using Pygame and Pytorch for training the agent. The repository consists of 4 major steps:
1. Defining the layout, reset, playing steps, and UI update of the game using Pygame (Refer file game.py)
2. Creating the agent that controls the game and learns optimal actions in the training to ensure high score with successive iterations (Refer file agent.py)
3. Implementing the neural network that implements Linear Q learning, and trains the agent to predict moves for maximizing the rewards (Refer file model.py)
4. Plotting the training performance using Matplotlib and analyzing improvements (Refer file helper.py)

All credits to @patrickloeber for his guidance and hands on tutorial in the entire process.
